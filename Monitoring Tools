Continuos monitoring Phase

- System errors such as
	Low memory
	server not reachable
- Roots Cause is also determine by continuous monitoring
- Network issue  also resolved in this phase

Grafana will help us to visualize the real time data in an application and working of data in real-time

Why need of continuous monitoring
	- Better network visibility & Transperancy
	- Facilitates Rapid Response
	- Minimizes System Down time
	- Assists with Healthy Business Performance
